# Wearable-Baby-Monitor-IoT
The Wearable Baby Monitor is a device designed to continuously monitor a baby's vital signs and movements, providing real-time data to parents and caregivers. The device collects data on temperature, pulse, blood pressure, location (GPS), and motion, which is then reported to a cloud-based dashboard accessible via a website or mobile application.
